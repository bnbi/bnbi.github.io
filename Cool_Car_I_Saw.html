            I was walking my dog the other day on a new route, and, by pure chance, passed by a Lancer Evo 4 parked next to the curb. What’s more, the car was right hand drive (RHD), so it was most likely imported. You can also see a type R in the background, but I digress. This post is just going to be me yapping about cars and engines and the physics hidden inside. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The engine of the Evo 4 is the 4G63T, and it is highly regarded in the world of Rally Racing, as well as in other places such as the track and in drag races. The 4G in 4G63T means that the engine is an Inline 4 engine, and the T at the end means that the engine is turbocharged.
        </p>
        <p>
            First, let’s talk about the type of engine. The Evo 4 has an Inline 4, which essentially looks like this:
        </p>
        <div class="images">
            <img src="inline_4.jpg" alt="Picture of the inline 4" width="500px" height="auto">
        </div>
        <p>
            Just to be clear, the Inline 4 is not the only type of engine. There are many ways to design an engine using pistons. For example, the other most common engine type is the V engine, where instead of being in a straight line, the pistons are doubled up and form a V. There are also ways to design an engine without using pistons at all, like the rotary engine Mazda used to make back in the day. However, all of these engines fundamentally do the same thing, and the main difference between them is how they are designed.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can see in the image above that there are 4 pistons, each of which is connected to a bar of metal. When the pistons move up and down, they rotate the crankshaft, and this rotation is eventually transferred to the wheels. Above each piston is a pocket of air, which expands and contracts to move the piston up and down. The car engine is a four stroke engine, and the four strokes are, in order: the intake stroke, the compression stroke, the power stroke, and the exhaust stroke. In the intake stroke, air is combined with fuel and pumped into the cylinder. Then, in the compression stroke, the piston moves up, compressing the air. The spark plug ignites the fuel, leading to the power stroke, where the piston is pushed downwards with the expanding air. Finally, the exhaust exits during the exhaust stroke.
        </p>
        <div class="images">

        </div>
        <p>
            The 4-stroke process is also called the Otto Cycle. The Otto Cycle is a thermodynamic cycle, and it can be graphed onto a PV diagram. Here’s what the Otto Cycle looks like:
        </p>
        <div class="images">
            <img src="otto.jpg" alt="PV diagram of the Otto Cycle" width="500px" height="auto">
        </div>
        <p>
            We can see that the Otto cycle is composed of 4 thermodynamic processes. In order of occurrence, we have an adiabatic compression, an isochoric process, an adiabatic expansion, and another isochoric process. The adiabatic compression corresponds to the compression stroke, where the piston moves up to compress the air. The first isochoric process corresponds to the moment between the compression stroke and the power stroke, when the spark plug ignites the gasoline in the cylinder. The adiabatic expansion corresponds to the power stroke, where the piston moves down and the volume increases inside the cylinder. Finally, the last isochoric process corresponds to the moment right after the power stroke, when the cooling system cools down the gas. Then, the exhaust stroke and intake stroke happen, and the cycle starts over. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To make an engine more powerful, we can add either a turbocharger or a supercharger. Both of these help increase power output, as both compress the air that goes into the engine. Because the air is compressed, more moles of air make it into the engine through the intake stroke, and so the power stroke becomes more powerful. However, there is a difference between how superchargers and turbochargers operate. The supercharger is powered by the crankshaft, while the turbocharger is powered by the engine exhaust gas.
        </p>
        <p>
            For a supercharger, air first passes through an air filter and enters the supercharger. Then, rotors inside the supercharger funnels the incoming air, compressing it and passing it along to the engine’s air intake system. The supercharger is completely mechanically driven, which means that the rotors that turn inside the supercharger are powered by the crankshaft. The crankshaft is connected to the supercharger pulley through a belt, and so as the engine turns the crankshaft, the rotors inside the supercharger turn as well. There are many types of superchargers, notably the roots, twin screw, and centrifugal superchargers. The centrifugal supercharger closely resembles a turbocharger in terms of looks, but it is still mechanically driven and physically connected to the crankshaft.
        </p>
        <p>
            For turbochargers, air still passes through an air filter before entering the turbo. However, instead of being powered by the crankshaft, the rotor inside the turbo is powered by exhaust gas exiting the engine. Unlike the supercharger, the turbo has two compartments: the turbine section and the compression section. As exhaust gas leaves the engine, it enters the turbine section of the turbo and powers the exhaust wheel. The exhaust wheel is connected to the compressor wheel inside the compression section, which then rotates compresses air coming from the air filter.
        </p>

        <p>
            Supercharges can provide boost immediately, no matter the RPM. However, because they are connected to the crankshaft, some of the power made by the engine goes into the supercharger, and so superchargers are not as efficient. On the other hand, because turbochargers are not mechanically connected in any way, it takes time for the turbine to build up speed from the exhaust gas, and so the boost from the turbo is not immediate. However, because exhaust gas would otherwise be waste, turbochargers do not reduce horsepower, and so they are more efficient than superchargers. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Evo 4 that I saw on the side of the road uses a turbo. Usually, turbos are added to cars with smaller engines, such as the inline 4 that the Evo 4 has. On the other hand, you can expect to see superchargers in cars that have a V8 engine, such as the Hellcat or the Corvette ZR1. While both turbos and superchargers help the car make more power, they are not the only thing that do so. There are several things that you can tweak in your car to achieve higher performance. Even tweaking the exhaust can give your car more horsepower, and it relies on even more physics principles, but I’ll save that for another day. Anyways, pretty cool stuff.
