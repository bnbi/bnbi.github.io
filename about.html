                    Hi! My name is Brian Bi, and I’m a rising senior at Lynbrook High School. I do competitive math and competitive physics, but I also occasionally do competitive programming. When I’m not working, I love to get angry at hockey games, watch hour long documentaries on youtube, and walk my golden retriever, Biscuit.

                    I've always found physics and math the most exciting when I am able to observe it in real life. So, this blog is going to be full of random thoughts of mine that relate to physics or math. I’ll talk about all the physics and math that I see or observe in everyday occurances in my life.  Don’t expect anything professional, as I’ll probably just be rambling most of the time.
