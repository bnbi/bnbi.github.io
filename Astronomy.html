            It seems that 2024 has become somewhat of a packed year for astronomy. First, we had a total solar eclipse pass through most of America in April. Then, the world was hit with a geomagnetic solar storm, resulting in the aurora borealis appearing as far south as Florida. Astronomy has strong ties to physics, so I decided to investigate these events for any connections to physics.

            For a total solar eclipse to happen, the moon would have to appear just as large to us as the sun does, even though the sun is many times larger than the moon. The sun is around 400 times the size of he moon, and it just so happens that it is also around 400 times the distance away from Earth as it is from the moon. So, to viewers on Earth, the sun appears to be as large as the moon. That way, when the moon passes in front of the sun, it perfectly covers the star and we get a total eclipse. Whats interesting is that this is a complete coincidence. It just so happens that both the sun and the moon have the same apparent area in our sky. In fact, assuming humanity survives for enough time, our descendents may not be able witness these eclipses. The moon is moving away from us at around 1.5 inches a year. At the celestial scale, 1.5 inches is nothing, but this recession adds up. In only about 620 million years, total solar eclipses will begin to cease to be a thing for viewers on Earth. So, we should be counting our blessings that we can witness such a beautiful phenomenon in our lifetimes.

            However, thats not the only special thing about total solar eclipses. Alongside being complete coincidences, total solar eclipses also helped to prove Einstein’s theory of general relativity. General relativity is just special relativity with gravity involved. Most people know of special relativity, with the most well known physics equation being E=mc^2. However, special relativity ignored gravity. General relativity proposed that gravity affected light. In other words, general relativity proposed that gravity could affect and bend the path of the photon, which is massless. At the time, this was a radical claim. For context, in classical kinematics, a massless object can’t be affected by acceleration or forces. So, gravity affecting light would break Newton’s explanation of gravity. Einstein wanted to prove his claim, and so he devised a plan to use a total solar eclipse. In 1919, an expedition of astronomers traveled to the west coast of Africa to observe a total solar eclipse. During the event, they charted the stars visible surrounding the blocked-out sun. Then, after the eclipse, they once again observed those same stars, only to find that the stars were now in different positions. Obviously, the stars didn’t move in the sky, so the only explanation was that the light from the stars were manipulated somehow; more specifically, the gravity from the sun had caused the light from distance stars to bend, resulting in different percieved positions. Nowadays, we call this phenomenon gravitational lensing, because gravity bends light like a lens.

            Its so fitting that humans were able to use the gift of perfect total solar eclipses to our advantage by proving one of the most groundbreaking theories in science. However, a total solar eclipse was not the only crazy event that happened this year. A month later, we experienced a massive geomagnetic solar storm not seen since 2003. Most people know that these solar storms cause auroras, but what are they really, and why do they cause colorful lights in our night sky?
        </p>
        <p>
            To understand auroras, we first have to look at the sun. The sun produces its energy at its core, in a process known as fusion. In this process, smaller elements are fused together to make larger elements. For example, hydrogen may be “fused” together to become helium. The energy from this process radiates out the sun through convection currents. This is similar to the convection currrents we have in the Earth’s magma, or the smaller convection currents in your water when you boil it on the stove. In the sun, these convection currents form magnetic fields, which sometimes protrude outside of the surface of the sun. In a geomagnetic storm, the magnetic field is big enough to “break off” from the sun, taking with it tons of electrically charged gas. This plasma then makes its way towards Earth.

            Luckily, the Earth just so happens to have a defensive system for such a situation: a magnetic field that extends outside of its atmosphere. Although the magnetic field isn’t a solid barrier, it is still able to deflect oncoming solar storms. This is because charged particles moving through a magnetic field experience a magnetic force. A magnetic field does not act like an electric field or like a gravitational field. In the latter two fields, a particle can be influenced by the field whether it moves or not. For example, we stick to the Earth through gravity when we stand still and when we run. However, a particle in a magnetic field does not experience a force if it does not move. The equation for magnetic force is given as F = q(v x B), where q is the charge of the particle, v is the velocity of the particle, and B is the magnetic field. v and B are both vectors, which is why the formula uses the cross product. As you can see, if the velocity is 0, the force also becomes 0. So, as the plasma approaches Earth’s magnetic field, it is deflected by the magnetic force. Because the magnetic field lines point towards the poles, some of the particles are pulled towards the poles.

            As the particles enter Earth’s atmosphere, they interact with some of the elements present. The charged particles excite the gases in the atmosphere, which then emit photons as they return to their regular states. For example, when oxygen emits a photon that is visible to us, it is usually green, but it can also be red/pink. More specifically, oxygen in lower altitudes emit the green light, while oxygen in higher altitudes emit the red/pink light. This is because it takes less time to emit green light than it does red light. Oxygen lower to the ground is more concentrated, and the atmosphere thins out the higher you go. Oxygen atoms have more time at higher altitudes to emit red light, while lower oxygen atoms don’t have time to emit red light. They can only possibly emit green light before they inevitably collide with another oxygen atom, which unexcites the atom. This is why the aurora borealis is so green at the north pole, but gradually becomes more pink the further south you go. Down here in the bay area, the sky was (apparently, I didn’t get to see it) a really nice shade of purple and pink. This is because “green oxygen” sinks below the horizon as you move further south, leaving only the pink lights. This is also partly why we couldn’t see it with our naked eyes, as the intensity of the light was just not enough.

            So thats two of the most recent astronomical events somewhat explained. I think its really unique and cool to be able to experience both of these phenomena in less than 3 months, especially given the intracacies and the surprising stories behind some of them. Hopefully, you’ve gained some new appreciation for the things we see in the sky, and if you wish to stay engaged in astronomy, the next rare astronomical event is only a month or two away. The T Coronae Borealis nova explosion was last seen in 1946, and it has been predicted to happen again anytime before September(which I’ll probably write about). This nova will be so bright that we will be able to see it with our naked eyes, so be sure to stay tuned and watch out for that.
