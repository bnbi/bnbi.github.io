            Welcome to my first ever blog post! Hopefully you can tell by the banner on the homepage that this blog is just for fun and completely informal. However, if you really wanted to learn something, there might also be something here for you too. I love physics and math the most when I can see it in action, and so the plan is that most of these blog entries are going to be talking about random instances of physics or math I notice in real life. I know it sounds serious, but it’s really not. There are also going to be some blog posts about simple things that interest me. Most of if not all of the blog posts on here will be inspired by things I observe in my life, so expect to see a lot of different random topics.  
        </p>

            If I’m gonna be honest, most of these blog posts are going to be on here because I can’t rant about the topics in them to anybody else. I hope you enjoy reading these as much as I enjoy writing them, and that you find the topics as fascinating as I do.

            Also sorry about the poorly designed webpage, I’m not good at making things look good.
