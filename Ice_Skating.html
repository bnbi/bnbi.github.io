            One of my favorite pastimes is watching hockey. Recently, Connor McDavid of the Edmonton oilers just beat Wayne Gretzky’s record of most assists in a single playoff run. To distract myself from the fact that the oilers are losing badly in the Stanley Cup Finals right now, I decided to look into what makes Connor McDavid so great. McDavid is most well known for his explosive skating. In other words, he is the fastest player currently in the NHL. Skating is an essential part of hockey, yet most people either underestimate the importance of skating, or they don’t even know how ice skating works. Prior to my “research”, I was both of these people. Turns out, the skate blade can be customized in several ways, leading to a unique skating experience for each person.

            The secret to skating actually has everything to do with the skate blade. The two most important properties of the skate blade is its hollow and its profile. Most people may see each skate blade as the same, but it actually varies from skate to skate. First of all, the shape of the bottom of the skate is actually not what you may expect. Unlike a kitchen knife, where the blade has a V or triangular shape, the skate blade has an inverted semicircle shape, as shown below. The semicircle shape of a blade is often referred to as the hollow. This is a peculiar shape for a blade of any kind to take, but there is a good reason for why skate blades are shaped this way. Designing a skate blade this way allows for both grip and glide. The contact points on either side of the blade dig into the ice, which provides grip and allows for the skate to dig in on both the inside and outside edges of the foot.

        <p>
            We can customize the hollow of our blade by altering the radius of the removed semicircle. If we want our skate blade to be relatively flat, we can go for a higher radius of hollow, such as 1 inch. On the other hand, if we wanted a deeper semicircle, we could use a smaller radius of hollow, such as 1/2 inch. This customization of the blade is not just for looks. Like I said before, the hollow of the blade allows for the skate to both grip and glide. Changing the radius of hollow either makes a skate grippier or “glidier”. For example, using a radius of hollow of 1 inch causes the skate blade to be nearly flat, meaning the blade glides really well on the ice. However, since it’s nearly flat, it is harder for the blade to dig into the ice, leading to less grip. On the other hand, using a radius of hollow of 1/2 inch means that the grip will be fantastic, as the blade will dig really deep into the ice. However, because it is lodged into the ice, the blade will have more trouble gliding. Ultimately, when deciding what radius of hollow to use, one must factor in weight and play style, and so each person will have different skate hollows.

            Another important aspect of the blade is the profile. The profile of the blade is the shape of the entire blade. While it may look completely flat, the skate actually has a slight curve to it. Like the hollow of the blade, the entire blade itself can be described by a radius. The radius of a skate usually ranges from 7 feet to 13 feet, but most people tend to use the sizes in the middle. Just like the hollow of a skate, the profile of the skate can impact certain aspects of skating. A smaller radius means that the blade will be curved more, resulting in less blade being in contact with the ice. Smaller radii support faster turning and change of direction, but it doesn’t support gliding or faster skating. On the other hand, a larger radius means more contact with the ice, resulting in better gliding and faster skating speed, but slower change of direction. So, the profile and hollow allows the player to customize their skate to best fit their playing style.

            While many people underestimate the complexity behind the skate blade, I think even less people appreciate the complexity behind how skating works. The physics of how skating works has always been hotly debated. I remember I once saw a video from Veritasium about 7 or 8 years ago that discussed why ice was slippery. In the video, Derek explains to strangers that ice is slippery because the pressure from the skate onto the ice melts it, and the resulting water that is produced allows the skater to glide across the ice. This explanation for why ice is slippery stuck with me for the longest time, because I thought that it was a really cool reason for something that I took for granted. However, this is unfortunately not why ice is slippery. The pressure generated from the ice skate simply cannot decrease the melting point of ice enough to melt it. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The average hockey blade is 3 millimeters in width, and about 20 inches in length. 20 inches converts to around 0.508 meters. So, the area of contact between the skate and the ice is about 0.508 * 0.003 = 0.001524 m^2. If we assume that the skater is 170 pounds in weight, that converts to roughly 77.1 kg. Assuming the skater is skating using both legs, the weight is distributed over both legs equally, meaning each skate presses against the ice with around 77.1 * 9.8 / 2 = 377.79 N of force. This means that the pressure from each foot against the ice is F/A = 377.79/0.001524 = 247894 Pa. This is only about 2.45 times atmospheric pressure. Looking at the phase diagram of water, we can easily see that 0.2 MPa of pressure is going to do literally nothing to decrease the melting point of ice. So, pressure melting ice to create a thin film of water is not why ice is slippery.

            I think I must have been sad for about an entire day when I came across this revelation, because it meant that the cool explanation I had in my head all these years was wrong. The new explanation I found was a lot simpler. Ice is slippery because it has less friction. Because ice has less friction, there is less force opposed to movement, and so it’s easier for a person moving on ice to keep moving. But what gives ice less friction? The pressure theory is slightly correct in saying that the blade glides on water, because it turns out that ice, no matter what temperature, always has a thin layer of water on top. This layer on top gives ice its slippery nature. Some claim that this layer of water is formed from the heat due to friction between the skater and the ice, but this makes no sense either. There still exists a layer of water on top of ice even if the skater is not moving, so heat due to friction must not be the cause of the slippery nature of ice either.

            It seems like it is actually a property of ice to always have a thin film of water on top, no matter the temperature. However, we still do not know exactly why this is the case, and why ice is slippery is actually still an ongoing area of research. Some argue that even a thin film of water is not sufficient enough to make ice slippery. For example, putting a thin film of water on anything else, like a kitchen tile, doesn’t make it slippery. Some believe that the water on ice is more than just a thin film of water; rather, it is a collection of loose water molecules that act like ball bearings. Since the water molecules on the top layer of the ice don’t have any molecules to bond to on top of it, they can easily break off and tumble around the top of the ice. Therefore, ice is slippery because we roll on top of these loose water molecules. Still, this theory is not fully confirmed, but it does seem to be the most reasonable theory.

            I think its amazing that something we all know and love, ice skating, is based off of something so mysterious and unknown. It’s funny to think that ice skating is similar to things like dark matter and life itself in that it is still not yet fully understood. So, the next time you go out to ice skate, just remember that science can’t even agree on why you are moving the way you do on ice.
